### Project Vision (Your first task as a team)

We are trying to define how to manage survey, applications, and other intake data in Salesforce. This includes a series of questions that admins should ask themselves before setting it up and possible data models for surveys/applications/intake data.

### Project Team Accomplishments
We have come up with various draft data models with pros and cons. We have also built out what a key questions that an admin should be asking before implemetning a data model.

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
We want to finalize the wording of the key questions section. We also want to finalize the data models.

Then we would like to have the information published on the Power of Hub as a best practice.
